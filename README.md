# Artillery-Simulator

# Overview
The program is an artillery simulation written in C++. It allows players to control the angle and velocity of a projectile fired from an artillery cannon. The goal is to hit a target located at a specified distance. Players must account for factors such as gravity and wind resistance when aiming their shot. The program provides a graphical interface showing the cannon, target, and trajectory of the projectile.
